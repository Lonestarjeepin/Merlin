The Merlin Excel add-in was created to supplement Excel with many frequently-needed features that don't exist in native Excel.  The code for Merlin was largely written and/or "borrowed" from the internet by Lonestarjeepin, but with significant contributions by others along the way (noted in the code where applicable since this was created before GitHub).  I'm hoping by converting this from its previous hosting location (merlinaddin.xyz) to GitHub, that contributions from others can help grow the usefulness of the tool.
